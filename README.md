# python-api-challenge

This project uses Python and APIs to analyze weather patterns across the globe and plan ideal vacation destinations based on specific weather conditions. The challenge consists of two main deliverables: WeatherPy, which analyzes weather data based on latitude, and VacationPy, which uses this data to identify and map ideal vacation spots.

Main tools used for this project:

- APIs (OpenWeatherMap, Geoapify).
- andas and Matplotlib.
- Mapping and geospatial visualization with GeoViews.
